**Task 1 – Variable types**

Create a program that prints out one each of four types of variable, a string, an integer, a floating-point number and a boolean.  Assign values to variables and print each variable.  Do not output values directly in the print statements.

1.	The program requires no input. 
2.	The program will print the assignment of variables. 
3.	The program will output 4 lines. 
4.	On each line, the user will see the output of a variable of a given type.
5.	Beside the output on each line will be the variable type, e.g.

        A shoe - String
        12345 - Integer

**Task 2 – Police test**

Create a program that tests whether a user can join the police force. 
To be eligible to join the police, you must:

  - be over 18 years old.
  - have lived in the UK for the last three years.
  - have indefinite leave to remain and work in the UK.
  - be predicted or already have achieved a 2:2 degree or equivalent.
  - have any Level 3 qualification (equivalent to A-level).

1.	The program will take user input for each of the criteria listed above. 
2.	If the user fails to meet the criteria after answering all the questions, they will be informed that they are not eligible.
3.	All the questions must be asked individually 
4.	The program must use conditional statements.

**Task 3 – Even odd count**

Create a program that will count the even and odd numbers in the following list of numbers:

        nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

1.	The program will loop through all the numbers.
2.	The program will output how many odd numbers are in the list.
3.	The program will output how many even numbers are in the list. 

**Task 4 – Sums**

Write a function that receives a list as a parameter and will return the sum of all the numbers in it.  Call the function with this list to test: 

        nums = [3,4,5,10,12,14] 

For this list, the returned value should be 48.

1.	The function will receive a list as a parameter.
2.	The function will return a number.
3.	The number returned is the sum of the numbers in the list.

**Task 5 – Random number**

Write a function that will receive a list of numbers and return a random one from it.  Call this function with a list of your choosing to test. 

1.	The function will receive a list of numbers as a parameter.
2.	The function will return one of the numbers in the list.
3.	The returned number is randomly chosen from the list. 
4.	The number must exist in the original list. 

**Task 6 – Colour to hex**

The following is a list of colours and their hexadecimal equivalent: 

        Red - #ff0000
        Blue - #00ff00
        Green - #0000ff
        Orange - #ffa500
        Yellow - #ffff00

Write a function that will accept the colour as a word and return the hexadecimal equivalent.  You can use the list above as a reference. 

1.	The function will receive a single parameter.
2.	The function will return the hex code (as a string) that represents that colour. 
3.	You can create your own list of colours if you wish. 
4.	If the colour is not in the list, the function will return #000000.
5.	The value is case insensitive, e.g. if the argument in the function call is the string ‘Red’, ‘RED’ or ‘red’, the returned value is #ff0000.
